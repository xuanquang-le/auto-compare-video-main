# DESIGN.md — "So Sánh Kiến Thức" template

**Concept angle:** A fast-paced myth-busting showdown — two icons face off in a top-frame
split, a bold pink-accented caption calls the verdict line by line, and a flat 2D host
physically points the answer home. Motion reads as a game-show buzzer round, not a lecture.

## Colors

| Token           | Value     | Use                                              |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--bg`          | `#0D0A1A` | Root background (deep indigo-black)              |
| `--panel`       | `#17122C` | Image card surface                               |
| `--panel-edge`  | `#2B2350` | Card border / hairline                            |
| `--fg`          | `#F3F1FF` | Primary text                                      |
| `--fg-dim`      | `#9089B0` | Secondary / inactive text                         |
| `--accent-pink` | `#FF4FA3` | Keyword highlight — the "difference" word         |
| `--accent-cyan` | `#37E6C4` | Topic names, VS badge accent, avatar accent        |

Dark, saturated background: tech/knowledge content stays legible, and the deep indigo bed makes
the pink keyword pop hardest against the cool cyan identity color. Two accent hues sit opposite
on the wheel (pink for emphasis, cyan for identity) — chosen as a deliberate departure from the
series' original red/gold palette so this generation of videos reads as visually distinct from
earlier public uploads of the same topics.

## Typography

- **Be Vietnam Pro, 900** — captions, topic names, VS badge. Geometric sans, heavy weight only
  (extreme weight contrast per house style), not on the banned-monoculture list. Replaces
  Montserrat: the compiler's pre-bundled embed for Montserrat only covers the "latin" unicode
  range, which drops Vietnamese tone-mark glyphs (U+1EA0-1EF9) and renders diacritics broken.
  Be Vietnam Pro is purpose-built for Vietnamese and must be embedded via explicit `@font-face`
  + `unicode-range` (vietnamese + latin subsets) in `<head>` — **not** a Google Fonts `<link>`
  (trips the `google_fonts_import` lint warning) and **not** left as a bare `font-family` name
  (silently falls back to the incomplete pre-bundled embed). See either video's `index.html`
  `<head>` for the exact `@font-face` block to copy.
- **JetBrains Mono, 700** — eyebrow tag (`#eyebrow`, text sourced from `CHANNEL` in the
  repo-root `.env` — see the `create-video` skill's `scripts/sync-channel.mjs`; default
  "SO SÁNH KIẾN THỨC"), small labels. Crosses the
  sans→mono boundary against Be Vietnam Pro (never pair two sans-serifs). Same embedding rule
  applies — JetBrains Mono also needs its "vietnamese" subset explicitly `@font-face`-embedded
  when it renders Vietnamese text (e.g. the eyebrow tag).
- Caption line size: 64px (well above the 20px in-feed floor — this is a 9:16 in-feed video).
  Topic name in cards: 44px. Eyebrow tag: 22px, uppercase, tracked +0.12em.

## Layout (1080×1920)

Three fixed horizontal zones — this split is the template's contract; only content inside
each zone changes between topics. All zone content is horizontally centered on the **canvas
center** (x=540) with symmetric left/right padding — see Safe zone below.

- **Top — comparison zone** (`y 64–824`, 760px): two image cards, 400×680 each, 40px gap,
  card-left at x=120, card-right at x=560 (right edge 960, symmetric 120px margins). A round
  VS badge (110px, left=485) sits centered on the seam, overlapping each card ~35px so it
  reads as attached, not floating.
- **Middle — caption zone** (`y 840–1300`, 460px): one caption line visible at a time,
  centered, max-width 860px, left=110 (symmetric 110px margins). Keyword spans get
  `--accent-pink`.
- **Bottom — avatar zone** (`y 1280–1920`, 640px): a flat CSS/SVG 2D robot host character
  (`#avatar-host` top=1280, left=330, horizontally centered like every other zone) — rounded-rect
  head with a glowing antenna tip, an LED-style visor with two square eyes, a speaker-bar mouth,
  rectangular mechanical arms, and a glowing chest light on the torso. Arms swap rotation per
  beat (point-left / point-right / shrug / explain / neutral-hold). Top raised from the original
  y=1360 so the head/face clears the platform caption/username band — see Safe zone.

## Safe zone (platform UI overlays)

TikTok/Reels/FB in-feed chrome overlays the raw 1080×1920 frame: an engagement-icon rail near
the right edge and a caption/username/progress-bar band at the bottom. Fix this with symmetric
padding and vertical clearance, not by shifting the composition's horizontal center — an
off-center layout reads as broken on any device/platform that *doesn't* show that overlay.

| Constant        | Value  | Meaning                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SAFE_MARGIN`     | 120px  | Minimum clearance from both the left and right edge (symmetric)    |
| `SAFE_BOTTOM`     | 380px  | Clearance from the bottom edge (caption/username/progress band)    |
| horizontal center | 540    | Raw canvas center — every zone stays centered here                 |

Only the avatar's head/upper body must clear `SAFE_BOTTOM` (y ≥ 1540 is unsafe) — the lower
torso/hands may bleed under the platform band since they carry no readable information. Card
icon internals that use fixed pixel offsets (not `%`/`translateX(-50%)` centering) must be
re-checked for overflow whenever card width changes; icons built via grid `place-items:center`
with no `top`/`left` adapt automatically.

## Background layer

- Base layer: `assets/bg-plexus.gif` (dark teal/navy plexus network — dots joined by thin
  lines, matches the deep indigo-black `--bg`), full-bleed `background-size: cover` behind
  everything else, tinted with a flat `rgba(13, 10, 26, 0.55)` overlay (same hue as `--bg`)
  so foreground text/cards keep contrast. `#bg-plexus` sits as the first child inside `.clip`
  (before the glow divs), same static full-canvas div pattern as the glows — not itself a
  timed element. Every video's `assets/` folder carries its own copy of this file (same
  bytes) since HyperFrames projects are self-contained per video. The loop's own length must
  be **≥ that video's `data-duration`** (`lint`'s `clip_media_fit` warns and the slot gets
  silently shortened to the media length otherwise, cutting the background short mid-video) —
  the 8-line/15-20s videos shipped with a 21s loop; a 12-line/30-40s video needs a longer
  render (`ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -i bg-plexus.mp4 -t <duration+buffer> …`). Always pin the
  keyframe interval explicitly (`-g 30 -keyint_min 30`, 1s at 30fps) — libx264's default GOP
  (~250 frames / 8.3s) is too sparse for HyperFrames' frame-accurate seeking and trips the
  render-time `sparse keyframes` warning (visible freezing/seek failures in the output MP4).
- Soft `--accent-pink` radial glow behind the VS badge, low opacity, gentle breathing pulse
  (finite repeat) — layered on top of the plexus base.
- Ghost eyebrow word ("SO SÁNH") oversized at 4% opacity behind the caption zone, static.
- Soft `--accent-cyan` glow behind the avatar's head, gentle breathing pulse, phase-opposed
  to the top glow (per `sine-wave-loop` phase-opposition rule) — layered on top of the plexus
  base.

## Motion

- **Image cards**: `spring-pop-entrance` (scale 0→1, `power3.out`, ~0.5s), staggered ~0.15s
  left-then-right. VS badge pops ~0.3s after on `spring-pop-entrance` (small hero pop).
- **Caption lines**: one line visible per beat window; each enters with `spring-pop-entrance`
  (y:24→0 + fade, `power3.out`, 0.35s) and exits with a fast fade+lift
  (`power2.in`, 0.2s) before the next line pops. Keyword spans get a quick color-set +
  scale-punch (1→1.15→1, 0.25s) timed to the line's entrance — a simplified,
  line-level cousin of `asr-keyword-glow` (no continuous per-word envelope; this is a
  30-40s fast-cut format, not a lyric-video read).
- **Avatar arms**: discrete rotation tweens per beat, `power3.out`, ~0.3s — point-left,
  point-right, shrug (both arms up+out), explain (one arm lower, open palm), neutral
  (arms at rest) for the outro hold.
- **Active-side emphasis**: during Giải A / Giải B, the inactive card dims to 55% opacity +
  scales to 0.96; the active card stays at full opacity/scale — directs the eye without a
  camera move (`camera-static` — the split symmetry is the subject early, but attention
  shifts once the verdict starts).

## Rhythm

Target total: **30–40s** per video (raised from the original 15-20s demo — more room per
concept). Timing is VO-driven (real TTS clip durations, not fixed beat-seconds — see the
`create-video` skill's timing-gap formula), but the beat *order* and *line budget* are fixed:

`hook(2 dòng) → question(1 dòng) → reveal-A(3 dòng) → reveal-B(3 dòng) → so-sánh-trực-tiếp(2 dòng) → payoff-hold(1 dòng)`
≈ 12 dòng thoại. `reveal-A`/`reveal-B` each grew from 2 lines to 3 (definition, key trait, one
concrete example/analogy per side) and a new side-by-side contrast beat (`so-sánh-trực-tiếp`)
sits right before the verdict — that's where the extra 15-20s of runtime goes, not into slower
pacing. Energy: punchy open, a beat of pause at the question, two deeper reveal holds, a settled
payoff dwell (≥1s per the climax-dwell rule). If the natural total falls short of 30s, add
another sentence or example line — never stretch inter-line gaps to pad time (that breaks the
fast-cut house style). No shader transitions — this is one continuous scene, not scene cuts;
all beats are internal phase changes on one timeline.

## Do's and don'ts

- Do keep the 3-zone layout byte-for-byte identical across topics — only text, image
  content, and the two card images change when this becomes a real template instance.
- Do keep keyword-pink reserved for the *difference*, not the topic names (topic names use
  cyan) — the color coding itself teaches the viewer where to look.
- Do keep every zone's content within the safe zone (above) — centered on x=540 with symmetric
  `SAFE_MARGIN` on both sides, avatar head clear of `SAFE_BOTTOM`.
- Don't add a 4th zone or reorder the three zones — the format's recognizability depends on
  the fixed vertical stacking (top comparison → middle caption → bottom avatar). Raising the
  avatar zone's top offset to respect `SAFE_BOTTOM` is a safe-zone fit, not a reorder.
- Don't animate more than one caption line at a time — line-by-line, never word-by-word
  (this is a fast format, not a karaoke lyric video).
