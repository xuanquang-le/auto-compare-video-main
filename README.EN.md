# Knowledge Comparison Video Generator — Comparison Video Template

**A short-form educational video template (TikTok/Reels/Shorts)** built on **[HyperFrames](https://hyperframes.heygen.com)** — each video compares a pair of commonly confused concepts, following one fixed layout/pace, only the content changes.

Live screenshots taken from the current composition (`hyperframes snapshot`) — the purple-pink-cyan
color palette and 2D robot avatar are the **current default** look for the whole series (see
[Color Palette & Design](#-color-palette--design)).

## 📌 Key Features

- **Standardized 3-part layout** (see details in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)):
  1. **Top half** — 2 illustration cards placed side by side with CSS/SVG (concept A on the left, B on the right).
  2. **Middle section** — animated running caption, highlighting key words with a preset color.
  3. **Bottom half** — a 2D robot MC avatar with 4 poses (point left, point right, curious shrug,
     explain), mouth/eyes LEDs blink in sync with the narration's rhythm.
- **Automatic voiceover** — supports **3 TTS providers**: **Vbee TTS API** (high quality, requires account), **[Edge TTS](https://github.com/travisvn/edge-tts-universal)** (free, no API key needed, pure Node.js), and **Gemini TTS** (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`, several prebuilt voices). Uses `ffprobe` to measure each sentence's real duration to sync GSAP animation down to the millisecond (no guesswork).
- **Proper Vietnamese font** — Be Vietnam Pro embedded via `@font-face` + `unicode-range`, no diacritic rendering issues like with a compiler's default font.
- **Many videos, one template** — each video is an independent HyperFrames project under `videos/`, sharing the same design/credentials, easy to clone for a new topic.

## 🎨 Color Palette & Design

The full layout/color/font/motion contract lives in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) — every video in the
series must follow this exact color palette and 3-zone structure to keep the series visually consistent.

| Token | Hex | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--bg` | `#0D0A1A` | Main background (purple-tinted black) |
| `--panel` | `#17122C` | Illustration card background |
| `--panel-edge` | `#2B2350` | Card / robot border |
| `--fg` | `#F3F1FF` | Primary text |
| `--fg-dim` | `#9089B0` | Secondary text / labels |
| `--accent-pink` | `#FF4FA3` | Highlighted keywords, robot eyes/mouth |
| `--accent-cyan` | `#37E6C4` | Topic name, robot head, chest light |

```

Each video under `videos/` is a **fully independent** HyperFrames project (its own `npm run dev/check/render/publish`), only sharing the root `.env` and the design rules in `DESIGN.md`.

## 🛠️ Requirements
1. An AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) to invoke the automated video-creation skill.
2. **TTS provider** (pick one of three):
   - **[Vbee TTS](https://vbee.vn/ref/5GTJ9TGU)** — high quality, many Vietnamese voices, requires an account (App ID + Access Token).
   - **[Edge TTS](https://github.com/travisvn/edge-tts-universal)** — free, no API key needed, Microsoft Neural voices. Already bundled via npm (`edge-tts-universal`), nothing extra to install.
   - **Gemini TTS** — requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Google AI Studio). Several prebuilt voices (Achird, Puck, Kore, Charon, Leda, Orus, Zephyr...). Free tier caps at 3 requests/minute — the script paces calls and waits out rate limits automatically.
3. **Node.js** ≥ 18
4. **FFmpeg & FFprobe** on your `PATH` — needed to measure audio duration and render video


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set up credentials (shared across all videos)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the **repo root**, then fill in the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
TTS_PROVIDER=edge                    # "edge" (free) or "vbee" (requires account)
EDGE_VOICE=vi-VN-NamMinhNeural      # Edge TTS voice — male: NamMinhNeural, female: HoaiMyNeural
CHANNEL=Cường IT                     # channel name shown on the eyebrow tag
AUTO_CREATE_VIDEO=0                  # 0 = confirm each step | 1 = run automatically
```

> **Uses Edge TTS (free) by default** — runs entirely in Node.js (via [`edge-tts-universal`](https://github.com/travisvn/edge-tts-universal)), no Python or API key needed. For Vbee TTS (higher quality): set `TTS_PROVIDER=vbee` and add `VBEE_APP_ID`, `VBEE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `VBEE_VOICE_CODE` — see `.env.example` for the full list.

`.env` is not committed (already in `.gitignore`) — only `.env.example` is checked into the repo as a template.

### 2. Create a new video

The fastest way — use **Claude Code**, invoke the built-in skill with the pair of concepts you want to compare, e.g.:

```
/create-video Dev and DevOps
```

Just this one command and the skill handles the rest automatically: asks/confirms the concept pair +
a 12-line script (unless `AUTO_CREATE_VIDEO=1` — see step 1), initializes the project, generates the
VO narration, builds the composition per `DESIGN.md`, and runs `npm run check` — see details in
[`.claude/skills/create-video/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/create-video/SKILL.md).

**Using Google Antigravity?** An equivalent skill ships at
[`.agents/skills/create-video/`](.agents/skills/create-video/) — clone this repo and Antigravity picks
it up automatically, no install needed. You don't type a skill name, just ask normally:

```
Make a comparison video about Dev and DevOps
```

See [`.agents/skills/create-video/README.md`](.agents/skills/create-video/README.md) for installing it
globally and how it differs from the Claude Code version.

Not using either agent, or want to run each step manually — follow the section below:

<details>
<summary>Manual steps (without the skill)</summary>

**Generate narration for a video:**

```bash
cd videos/thien-thach-vs-sao-bang
node scripts/generate-vo.mjs
```

Downloads audio into `assets/vo/*.mp3` and writes the real durations into `assets/vo/durations.json`.

**Preview / check / render:**

Every command runs with the current directory set to the **video's folder** (since `package.json` lives there):

```bash
cd videos/thien-thach-vs-sao-bang
npm run dev       # preview server (long-running)
npm run check     # lint + layout + motion + contrast
npm run render    # render to renders/*.mp4
npm run publish   # publish and get a shareable link
```

**Create a completely new video (instead of duplicating an existing one):**

1. Create a new folder `videos/<new-video-name>/`, run `npx hyperframes@latest init` inside it.
2. Copy the HTML/CSS/timeline structure from an existing video, keeping the layout contract in `DESIGN.md` intact — only change the content/icons/audio for the new topic.
3. Write a dedicated `BRIEF.md` for that video (topic, comparison angle, script).
4. Run `node scripts/generate-vo.mjs` then `npm run check` before considering it done.

## 🤝 Contributing

This repo is open for cloning/customization. If you add a new video or modify the template, keep the fixed 3-zone layout in `DESIGN.md` (this is the "contract" that keeps the whole series consistent) — any other changes (topic, script, icons) are welcome. Open a PR or issue if you find a bug or want to suggest an improvement.
